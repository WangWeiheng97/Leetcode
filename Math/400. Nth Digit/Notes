Just don’t understand why the type of count should be ‘long’ instead of ‘int’?

Because of overflow.

Let’s say we use int instead of long.

int count can take 2,147,483,647 maximally.
When you do count = 9 * 109, which is 9,000,000,000, int count overflowed.
It will be considered as a small positive number, instead of the large positive number you intend to have.
