10 is the product of 2 and 5. In n!, we need to know how many 2 and 5, and the number of zeros is the minimum of the number of 2 and the number of 5.

Since multiple of 2 is more than multiple of 5, the number of zeros is dominant by the number of 5.


*******
5=1*5, 10=2*5, 15=3*5, 20=4*5, 25=5*5, 30=6*5 ... , 50=10*5=2*5*5, did you see that the numbers before each 5 in the multiplications: 1,2,3,4,5,6,...,10 has formed the (n/5) subproblem?
