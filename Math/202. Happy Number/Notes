Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm:
This is the fastest method. Traverse linked list using two pointers.  Move one pointer by one and other pointer by two.  If these pointers meet at some node then there is a loop.  If pointers do not meet then linked list doesn’t have loop.

It can also be applied to this problem, since this problem is also cycle detection problem.
