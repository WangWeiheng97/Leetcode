This problem can be solved by recursion;

Bace case + common case (AND DONT forget to return in every case)

However, the recursion has a disadvantage such that:
this would be a terrible solution from a practical point of view, as the stack size would be equal to the length of the merged list, which would result in a stack overflow for relatively small lengths of lists.
