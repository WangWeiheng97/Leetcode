List<Integer> list = new List<Integer>(); // It's illegal!!

In Java, List is an interface. That is, it cannot be instantiated directly.

Instead you can use ArrayList which is an implementation of that interface that uses an array as its backing store (hence the name).

Since ArrayList is a kind of List, you can easily upcast it:

List<T> mylist = new ArrayList<T>();

List<List<String>> bogus = new ArrayList<List<String>>();

Must create and implement insideList first, and then add the insideList into the major "List"
