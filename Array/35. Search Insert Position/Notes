Method 1: Brute Force 
Traverse the whole array until find something satisfied.

Method 2: Binary Search
Basically, the mission is to search one number in a sorted array, so you should come up with bianry search tree natrually.




****************

Basic implement of bianry search method:

    public int searchInsert(int[] A, int target) {
        int low = 0, high = A.length-1;
        while(low<=high){
            int mid = (low+high)/2;
            if(A[mid] == target) return mid;
            else if(A[mid] > target) high = mid-1;
            else low = mid+1;
        }
        return low;
    }


    eventually, low will be the next from high.
