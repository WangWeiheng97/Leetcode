Why do we need HashMap for this problem, since HashMap can detect duplicate!

Thought:
1. Need to traverse all element in this array, which means we must use at least one for loop
2. We need to know the recentest duplicate element which same with the element we are doing now.
3. We also need to know is there any other duplicate element between them.
